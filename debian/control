Description: Cross Platform Password Manager
 KeePassXC is a free/open-source password manager or safe which helps you
 to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your
 passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a
 key-disk. So you only have to remember one single master password or
 insert the key-disk to unlock the whole database. The databases are
 encrypted using the algorithms AES or Twofish.
